## ðŸ“Œ Sorting Algorithms Covered

| #  | Algorithm Name         | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Code Link |
|----|------------------------|-----------------|------------------|-----------|
| 1  | Bubble Sort            | O(nÂ²)           | O(1)             | [BubbleSort.java](./BubbleSort.java) |
| 2  | Selection Sort         | O(nÂ²)           | O(1)             | [SelectionSort.java](./SelectionSort.java) |
| 3  | Insertion Sort         | O(nÂ²)           | O(1)             | [InsertionSort.java](./InsertionSort.java) |
| 4  | Inbuilt Sort (Java)    | O(n log n)      | O(log n)         | [InbuiltSort.java](./InbuiltSort.java) |
| 5  | Counting Sort          | O(n + k)        | O(k)             | [CountingSort.java](./CountingSort.java) |

> âœ… All codes are beginner-friendly and include comments + dry runs.
